In the context of this project, there are several key terms and tokens that you should be familiar with:

## Explanation:
### PyBridge:
- **PyBridge.py:** This is the main application
* **Request.py:** The HTTP request script that is used to ``trigger`` API processes.
* **set_in_stone.py:** This is a flexible logger function that is used to log the different types of processes, requests and functions.

### Tokens:
- **MASTER_TOKEN:** Acts like a license key, granting the requestor the right to send requests to PyBridge.
- **DEVELOPER_TOKEN:** Used to change settings within PyBridge, such as enabling or disabling processes.
- **USER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger PyRocesses
- **TESTER_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger TEST PyRocesses
- **PYROCESS_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger a specific PyRocesses.

### Heartbeat Monitor:
* The **Heartbeat Monitor** is a separate project that isn't directly related to **PyBridge**, however it does play a critical role in the stability and reliability of **PyBridge**.
	* The usage of the **Heartbeat Monitor** will be to read the ``Pulse`` of **PyBridge** at a set interval and create a ``GitHub Issue`` and send a ``SMS Alert`` if **PyBridge** does not respond with a ``Pulse``.

### Other lingo:
* **PyRocesses:** This is a combination of ``Py`` (short for Python) and the word ``Processes``.
