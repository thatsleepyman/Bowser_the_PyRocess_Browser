In the context of this project, there are several key terms and tokens that you should be familiar with:

## Explanation:
### Scripts:
- **PyBridge.py:** This is the main application
* **Request.py:** The HTTP request script that is used to ``trigger`` API processes.
* **set_in_stone.py:** This is a flexible logger function that is used to log the different types of processes, requests and functions.

### Tokens:
- **MASTER_TOKEN:** Acts like a license key, granting the requestor the right to send requests to PyBridge.
- **PROCESS_TOKEN:** Allows the requestor to send data to and trigger PyRocesses.
